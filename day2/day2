js es6 provides collections using sets and maps

so basically whats happening is the first method of creating the map was a set inside 
sets op shows no properties needs to be iterrated as its an object {}

array on the other hand  [] can be viewd - it is indexed


event handlng in js - 2 ways
obtrusive
unobtrusive

whenever an event occurs it gets propogated intrnally and this mechanism which defines the event propogation that travels through dom tree

2 types of event propogations
event bubbling 
event capturing

body div button tags -> event propogation can go from bottom- button to div to body (inner to outer ) --- it is event bubbling
when it bubbles up the dom tree

from outer to inner that is body to div to btn it is capturing - reverse
